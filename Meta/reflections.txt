API or model: what is the difference?
api: 
getRootTuples(): Tuples
getVariables(Tuple):Variables
getSubTuples(Tuple):Tuples
createTuple(Tuple):Tuple
createVariable(Tuple):Variable
createConstraint(Tuple, Variables)

api GET and api SET

scenario: gives formulation to the system
1) constructs data conforming with a model
2) calls a SET api (this is the usual way)
3) implements a GET api (call back variant)
1) and 2) are the same, except that with 1) I can use the model as help structure
How is it different from 3)? Procedural versus declarative
Which one is the strongest?
If I have 12, 3 can be automated.
If I have 3, 1 can be automated.
Which one is the easiest to implement?

Conclusion:
  consumer
    should publish the GET api (callback)
  producer: 
    either implement the GET api
    of construct a model implementing the GET api

scenario receives a formulation from the system
1) naviguates data conforming with a model
2) calls a GET api (this is the usual way)
3) implements a SET api (call back variant)
